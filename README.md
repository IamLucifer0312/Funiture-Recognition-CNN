# Machine-Learning-Team-7

# Please download the components via this GGDrive link:

# Extract them and bring the two subfolders: Splited_Data, and model to the same folder with your .ipynb code file

# There are three code files: DataPrep for spliting dataset into training, validating, and testing data. TrainModel to train the model (which I have already done). TestModel for loading the model.h5 file and testing the model.
